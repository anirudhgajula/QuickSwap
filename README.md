# Quick Swap - Enhancing Hash Timelock Contracts with Griefing Premiums

This project demonstrates Quick Swap for ERC 20 tokens on Hyperledger Besu, and GoEth on Goerli.

Quick Swap functions similar to a Hash Timelock Contract, with the addition of a Griefing Premium to ensure fairer compensation to users.

The ERC 20 token has been finalized, and the logic will be carried forward to facilitate GoEth transfers.
